# The Highest Low

### Summary
This fun little Jump and Run game for Windows has been the the winning entry in the SAE Munich Game Jam 2024.

It features 6 very hard levels, 2 composed music tracks, 3 different artstyles, a load of custom sound effects, quirks, glitches, a high pitched gnome and lots and lots of mushrooms.
On the technical side the game was realized using the [Black Coat Game Engine](https://github.com/Neovex/BlackCoat) and the [Tiled Level Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org).
